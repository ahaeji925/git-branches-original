## Note About Data

There are methodological differences between how countries collect this data that one should seriously consider in making head-to-head comparisons between different countries.

The example code in this assignment would merely be a starting point, helping to analyze trends and tease out potential anomalies & outliers in the data for further evaluation.

This is a good reminder that a real analysis requires more than simple manipulation of numbers, but taking time to carefully understand the nuances of your data and how it was collected.
